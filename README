## Advanced Customization Tips

### Customizing the Layout

To customize the layout of your site, navigate to the `_layouts` directory. Here, you'll find templates for different types of pages, such as the homepage, blog posts, and standard pages. You can modify these templates to change the structure and appearance of your site.

### Adding Custom CSS

For more advanced styling, you can add custom CSS to the `assets/css/JekyllTwilight.css` file. This allows you to override the default styles and create a unique look for your site. For example, you can change the font, adjust spacing, or add custom animations.

### Using Includes

The `_includes` directory contains reusable components like headers, footers, and widgets. By modifying these files, you can make site-wide changes without having to edit each page individually. This modular approach makes it easier to maintain and update your site.

### Configuring the `_config.yml` File

The `_config.yml` file is where you can configure site-wide settings, such as the site title, description, and social media links. You can also enable or disable certain features, like comments or analytics, by editing this file. Make sure to restart the Jekyll server after making changes to see the updates.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Dependency Errors

If you encounter errors during the installation process, ensure that you have the correct versions of Ruby and Bundler installed. You can check the required versions in the `Gemfile` and update your environment accordingly.

### Page Not Updating

If changes to your site are not reflected, try clearing the Jekyll cache by running `jekyll clean` before serving the site again. This ensures that all cached files are removed and the site is rebuilt from scratch.

### Custom CSS Not Applying

If your custom CSS changes are not applying, make sure that the file is correctly linked in the HTML template. Also, check for any syntax errors in your CSS file that might prevent it from being processed correctly.
